# SentimentAnalysis
Internship project based on sentiment analysis applied on twitter data.
In social media platforms, a viral information or trending term (hashtags) draws attention. The viral
information asserts the impact of user content towards topic/terms for the duration. In a real-time sentiment analy-
sis, these viral terms could deliver potential insights for the analysis and decision-support. The traditional sentiment
analysis tools or strategy generates the level of predefined sentiments over social media content for the defined
duration, and lacks in the extraction of emotional impact created by the same. In these settings, it is multifaceted to
precisely estimate the emotional quotient viral information creates.
In this project, a novel algorithm is designed (i) to extract the sentiment and emotions quotient of a current viral
information over twitter data, (ii) to comparative analysis over two co-occurring trending/viral inf0rmartion, (iii)
also in-depth analysis of potential twitter text data via UI. The generated emotion quotients and micro-sentiment
reveals several valuable insights of a viral/trending topic, and assists in decision support. A use-case analysis over
real-time extracted data asserts significant insights, as generated sentiments and emotional effects reveals co-
relations caused by viral/trending information. The algorithm delivers an efficient, robust, and adaptable solution
for the sentiment analysis also.
